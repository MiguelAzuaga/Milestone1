1st step: installing
	download .iso file for debian x64
	create a vm with 1024MB Mem and 13GB space @(s)goinfre
	startup VM, selecting .iso file downloaded previously (install)

	hostname = "mqueiros42"	domain = "" user "mqueiros"

2nd step: creating disk partitions
	manually create partitions
	select the correct disk and create partition table
	create 2 partitions, 1 for booting (primary) and 1 more partition (logical)
		boot partition >> 500MB >> mount point >> /boot
		other partition >> max >> mount point >> none
	encrypt volumes >> select sda5 (logical)
	LVM: create group LVMGroup at sda5
	create volumes inside group:
		root	2GB
		home	2GB
		swap	1GB
		tmp		2GB
		srv		1.5GB
		var		2GB
		var-log	2GB
	Mount points:
		home	>> Ext4 >> /home
		root	>> Ext4 >> /
		swap	>> swap area   0
		srv		>> Ext4 >> /srv
		tmp		>> Ext4 >> /tmp
		var		>> Ext4 >> /var
		var-log	>> Ext4 >> manual >> /var/log
	finish
	say no to everything/leave fields blank except grub, install it
	verify by using these commands:
		$ lsblk
		$ cat /etc/os-release

3rd step: setting up the firewall and the ssh
	log in as root and install sudo with
		$su
		# apt update
		# apt install sudo
		# sudo usermod -aG sudo mqueiros
	this last command adds user mqueiros to sudo so the user gets sudo permitions
	edit sudoers.tmp to change password etc settings
		# sudo visudo
		Defaults passwd_tries=3
		Defaults badpass_message="Wrong password :("
		Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
		Defaults log_input
		Defaults log_output
		Defaults requiretty
	afterwards, create the directory for var/log/sudo
